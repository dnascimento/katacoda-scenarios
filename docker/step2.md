### Elevator pitch (for your manager, your boss...)
#### OK... Why the buzz around containers?

The software industry has changed

Before:
- monolithic applications
- long development cycles
- single environment
- slowly scaling up

Now:
- decoupled services
- fast, iterative improvements
- multiple environments
- quickly scaling out

**Deployment becomes very complex**

Many different stacks:
- languages
- frameworks
- databases

Many different targets:
- individual development environments
- pre-production, QA, staging...
- production: on prem, cloud, hybrid
