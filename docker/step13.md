## On-board developers and contributors rapidly

1. Write Dockerfiles for your application components

2. Use pre-made images from the Docker Hub (mysql, redis...)

3. Describe your stack with a Compose file

4. On-board somebody with two commands:

```bash
git clone ...
docker-compose up
```

With this, you can create development, integration, QA environments in minutes!
