## Escape dependency hell

1. Write installation instructions into an `INSTALL.txt` file

2. Using this file, write an `install.sh` script that works *for you*

3. Turn this file into a `Dockerfile`, test it on your machine

4. If the Dockerfile builds on your machine, it will build *anywhere*

5. Rejoice as you escape dependency hell and "works on my machine"

Never again "worked in dev - ops problem now!"
