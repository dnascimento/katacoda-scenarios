## Docker 30,000ft overview
In this lesson, we will learn about:

- Why containers (non-technical elevator pitch)
- Why containers (technical elevator pitch)
- How Docker helps us to build, ship, and run
- The history of containers

We won't actually run Docker or containers in this chapter (yet!).

Don't worry, we will get to that fast enough!
